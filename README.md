- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mullins182
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming with C++, C#, HTML, CSS & JavaScript in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to program at Computer Schule Stockelsdorf
- âš¡ Fun facts:
- Why do Java programmers wear glasses? Because they don't C# ^^

- The first computer bug was a real bug. In 1947, a moth got stuck in a Harvard Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction. Although the term "bug" was already used before this incident, it became a popular story in programming history
